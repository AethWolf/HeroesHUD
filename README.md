HeroesHUD
=========

Just a tweaked stock HUD specifically targeted at the MLP Heroes mod for TF2

In the /resource folder, you'll find a few files named hudplayerhealth_4x3.res, hudplayerhealth_16x9.res, etc. Pick your aspect ratio and remove the _4x3 or _16x9 or whatever from it. That should get it up and running right.

HUD crosshairs are out at the moment. If anyone wants them back, it'll be easy to re-add them.
